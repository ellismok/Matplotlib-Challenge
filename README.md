This case has a total of 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. We will be analyzing which drug regimen is most effective. 

## Final Results

* Clean data: remove duplicate mice and its data

* Create table: summary statistics

* Create bar plot two different methods: number of mice per time point for each regimen

* Create pie plot two different methods: by distribution of female and male mice

* Measure and calculate the quartiles and IQR: chose the top four of the best regimens to calcualte the final tumor volume for each mouse

* Create box and whisker plot: by the top chosen four regimens

* Create line plot: 

* Create a scatter plot: 

* Create linear regression model:
