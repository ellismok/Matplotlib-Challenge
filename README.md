In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. You have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. 

## Final Results

* Clean data: remove duplicate mice and its data

* Create table: summary statistics

* Create bar plot two different methods: number of mice per time point for each regimen

* Create pie plot two different methods: by distribution of female and male mice

* Measure and calculate the quartiles and IQR: chose the top four of the best regimens to calcualte the final tumor volume for each mouse

* Create box and whisker plot: by the top chosen four regimens

* Create line plot: 

* Create a scatter plot: 

* Create linear regression model:
